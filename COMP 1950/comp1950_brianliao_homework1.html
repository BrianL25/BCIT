		<h2>Biographical Information</h2>
			
		<p id="bio"><img src="http://bcitcomp.ca/students/bliao7/images/me.jpg" alt="Portrait of Brian" width= "480px" height= "490px">
		Brian was born in Taipei, Taiwan. His family immigrated to Canada when he was 10 years old. 
		Growing up in Vancouver, he enjoyed the wonderful outdoor landscape of British Columbia, which led him to 
		develop a strong interest in ecological and biological sciences. Brian eventually earned a Bachelor's degree 
		in Genome Biology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Toronto. After returning to Vancouver, 
		he has been working as a microbiologist at an agricultural and food testing company.</p>
		
		<h2>Overview of Web Development skills and Experience</h2>

		websites from COMP 1850. My skills in HTML5 and CSS3 are currently at an intermediate level. I am comfortable 
		with coding web pages using HTML, style text and content with CSS, and manage files and websites using FTP software.</p>

		<h2>My Favorite Websites</h2>
		
		<ol class="list_p">
			
			<li><a href="http://www.espn.com/">ESPN</a></li>
			
			<br>
			I find this website extremely useful for keeping up with sports. When I access the homepage, 
			I can see all the scores, updates, and latest developments in the sports I follow. The website design is very organized, 
			all the latest scores are displayed at the very top, the tabs on the top allow me to select the sport I want to see, 
			and all the latest news is shown in the middle. Furthermore, all contents are aligned neatly to ensure easy browsing.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<li><a href="https://wavescoffee.com/">Waves Coffee</a></li>
			
			<br>
			I like this website because it is very aesthetically pleasing. The colors employed on this web page are light, soothing,
			and easy on the eyes. The web page also uses contrasting colors to separate the content from the background. Furthermore, 
			darker colors are chosen to highlight important content in order to attract the visitor's attention.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<li><a href="http://www.mercedes-benz.ca/en/home">Mercedes-Benz</a></li>
			
			<br>
			I like the general layout of this website because of the color scheme, graphics, and alignment of content. The background 
			and color scheme of the website accentuates the vehicles being displayed. In a way, the colors of the website gives off a 
			luxurious vibe which rightfully describes the brand. As I scroll down the web page, all the contents are neatly aligned and 
			easy to navigate. I can easily find which car models I am interested in or if there are any special offers available.
