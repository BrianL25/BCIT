                <h2>Rationale</h2>

                  <p> We have made a series of changes to the COMP1950 page as currently seen on the BCIT website in
                     order to improve the experience for our students. The changes we have made and the reasoning behind
                      them is explained in detail below. <br><br>

                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="section2">

                  <h2>Changes</h2>
                  <h3>COURSE HOME PAGE</h3>
                  <p>For the COMP1850 and COMP1950 homepage we have displayed the introductory content as a column. The left hand
                    column includes details about the COMP1850 course and the right hand column includes details about the COMP1950 course.
                    We have laid out the content this way as we feel this gives students an easy and clear opportunity to see the inherent differences
                    between the two courses. Currently, the home page for bcitcomp.ca simply has links to each course page but we felt it best to add some
                    informative text about each module in the home page itself.
                    Users can navigate via the Nav bar to access the individual module pages. </p>
                    <h3>MODULE HOME PAGE</h3>
                    <p>Once users access the individual module home page they can see the entire list of lectures, course syllabus and a “what next’ section.
                      We have displayed the link of all lectures and on one page in order to make each lecture easily accessible. Furthermore, seeing a list
                       of each lecture on the module home page gives users a good idea of the content of the module. Next to each lecture link we have text
                       from the relevant section of the syllabus. <br><br>
                      The greatest change we have added is a dedicated link called “What Next”. The What Next page provides students with information of courses they should take
                      after COMP1950. For example, a link to the JavaScript, PHP and databases courses are included on this page with an explanation as to why students should take
                      these courses after COMP1950.  This gives students a clear idea of what industry expectations are with regards to language requirements and helps students plan
                       their future schedule.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Individual Lecture Pages</h3>
                     <p>The individual lecture pages is where the greatest number of changes have been made. First, we have decided that the sections for
                       each lecture will be placed in a heading which will then drop down with the section content. We have used a Jquery plugin for this functionality.
                       We have displayed the content this way because it allows students to each sub-topic for the lecture and then access the relevant section as they
                       see fit as opposed to having all content displayed at once in a long scroll down page. The Jquery plugin also works well for responsive websites. <br><br>
                       Second, you will notice that in some sub sections we have embedded videos to complement the written content. Essentially, learning through videos
                       and seeing other people code is a great resource and this adds to the student experience. Thus, we have added relevant YouTube videos to correspond
                       with the text as this provides a real life example of how someone would code what the students have just learnt. <br><br>
                       Moreover, we also have a separate download link on each lecture page whereby students will be directed to a separate page where
                      they can view all downloadable folders, pdf’s, lab notes etc. Instead of having these files scattered in the content we have laid them out in
                      a separate page for easier access.
