                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                  <p> For our final project in COMP 1950, Brian and I have worked together to create a metasite and protosite.
                      The tasks were delegated as follows: <br>
                      Suyash: Responsible for designing the Metasite, creating the Sitemap, presenting the Rationale in a professional matter and working with Brian to
                      design the Protosite and agreeing upon the changes that need to be made in order to improve the expereince for the users. <br><br>

                      Brian: Responsible for creating the and designing Protosite pages and ensuring that the code is semantic, fully functional
                      and implements the new features for improvement. Brian also co-designed the protosite mock up with Suyash. <br><br>

                      Below we have three images. The image on the left shows the layout of the old site. The images on the right shows screenshots of our new design.

                <h2>SiteMap</h2>
                <p>The Sitemap can be found by clicking the 'Sitemap' link in the navigation bar. Here you will find our sitemap for the Protosite.
                <br>The layout of the Protosite is slightly different to our current website. You can find more details about the changes and <br>
                    reasoning behind the changes on our Rationale page.</p>
