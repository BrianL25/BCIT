                        <p>A wise man once said, ‘Once you are tired of London, you are tired of life,” and I am pretty sure this is the truest
                            thing ever said. If you can’t find something you like to do in London, you are pretty much incapable of finding things
                            to do period. This city has absolutely everything, and there are essentially unlimited treasures to be found. From pop-ups
                            to cultural festivals to warehouse parties to comedy nights, from boat cruises to street art tours to rooftop bars to flower,
                            produce, antique, street food, clothing, vintage, and jewelry markets... there’s something for everyone. </p>

                        First we have the dialog tag as seen here.
                        The dialog  tag defines a dialog box or window.
                        The dialog element makes it easy to create popup dialogs and modals on a web page.
                        It is only supported in google chrome and opera.
                        <dialog open>This text is in a <mark>dialog tag</mark></dialog>
                        As you can see the 'dialog tag' in the box is in yellow. Because it is inside a mark tag.
