		<p class="normal_p"><span id= "first_site">#1 Wat Pho - Bangkok, Thailand</span></br></br>
		Wat Pho (the Temple of the Reclining Buddha) is a must-see for any first-time visitor to Bangkok. It is one of the largest Buddhist temple complexes in 
		the city and famed for its gigantic reclining Buddha statue that measures 46 meters long and is covered in gold. The temple compound is also the national 
		headquarters for the teaching and preservation of traditional Thai medicine, including Thai massage, a mandate legislated by Rama III when the tradition 
		was in danger of extinction.</br></br>
