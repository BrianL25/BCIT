		<h2>CSS Scrollbars</h2>
		
		<p>When an element's content is larger than the amount of space assigned to it. We can use a CSS property called <b><i>overflow</i></b> to instruct the browser on what to do if an box's contents is larger than the box itself.</p>
		<p> The <b><i>overflow</i></b> property can take one of the following values:</P>
		<table border="2">
		
			<tr><td><b>Value</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
			<tr><td>visible</td><td>Allows the content to overflow the borders of its containing element.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>hidden</td><td>The content of the nested element is simply cut off at the border of the </br>containing element and no scrollbars is visible.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>scroll</td><td>The size of the containing element does not change, but the scrollbars are </br>added to allow the user to scroll to see the content.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>auto</td><td>The purpose is the same as scroll, but the scrollbar will be shown only if </br>the content does overflow.</td></tr>
			
		</table>
		
		<p>Example of the scroll value:</p>
		
		<div class="auto">
