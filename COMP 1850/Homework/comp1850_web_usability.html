			<h1>Web Usability</h1>

		<div id="subheader1">
		
			<h2>A Useful Website</h2>
			
		</div>
		
		<div id="body1_2">
		
			<p><span class="highlight">A website I visit frequently:</span> <a href="http://www.espn.com/">ESPN</a></p>
			<p>I find this website extremely useful for keeping up with sports. The objective of the website is to give sports fans the latest scores, game schedules, analyses, and updates on sports teams they follow.  
			When I access the homepage, I can see all the scores, updates, and latest developments in the sports I follow. The website design is very organized, all the latest scores are displayed at 
			the very top, the tabs on the top allow me to select the sport I want to see, and all the latest news is shown in the middle. The website uses repetition to establish layouts and navigation locations. 
			Furthermore, all contents are aligned neatly to ensure easy browsing.</p>

			<h2>Effective Use of Color</h2>
			
		</div>
		
		<div id="body2_2">
		
			<p><span class="highlight">A website that uses color effectively:</span> <a href="https://wavescoffee.com/">Waves Coffee</a></p>
			<p>I find this website very aesthetically pleasing. The colors employed on this web page are light, soothing, and easy on the eyes. The web page also uses contrasting colors to separate the content from the
			background. Furthermore, darker colors are chosen to highlight important content in order to attract the visitor's attention.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<div id="subheader3">
		
			<h2>Appealing Layout</h2>
			
		</div>
		
		<div id="body3">
		
			<p><span class="highlight">A website with appealing Layout:</span> <a href="http://www.mercedes-benz.ca/en/home">Mercedes-Benz</a></p>
			<p>I like the general layout of this website because of the color scheme, graphics, and alignment of content. The background and color scheme of the website accentuates the vehicles being displayed. In a way, 
			the colors of the website gives off a luxurious vibe which rightfully describes the brand. As I scroll down the web page, all the contents are neatly aligned and easy to navigate. I
			can easily find which car models I am interested in or if there are any special offers available.</p>
