			<p> From this tutorial, I learned how to design basic buttons which can be deployed on websites. By utilizing the rectangle tool in photoshop, I outlined the shape and color of the button. I also typed out the text which would appear on the button
				using the text tool. I created the text and shape of the button on different layers so I can customize them individually. I also changed the gradient and opacity of the round rectangle to give the button
				a unique appearance.</p>
